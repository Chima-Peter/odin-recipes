    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Jollof rice is a rice dish from West Africa. Many would argue it first originated from Senegal, but others swear it's from Nigeria. No matter the origin, Jolof is one dish that binds us all across Africa, and it's swiftly gaining international recognition and popularity.</p>
    <p>Nigerian Jollof is a stewed base rice dish made with three main ingredients: rice, tomato/pepper- stew base, and African-style seasonings like curry powder, dried thyme, and chicken stock.</p>
