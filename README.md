The odin-recipe project focuses on creating a html landing page for a recipes blog. It currently only contains 3 recipes with room for more recipes soonest.

With the creation of this project, I've reinforced in me the knowledge of a number of concepts which inclues:
lists
html boilerplate
git workflow
links and imaging
headings and paragraphs

This is the ODIN-RECIPE project
